![md[RED]](https://raw.github.com/jaggermeister/mdRED/master/logo.png "md[RED] Markdown Style")

A clean and beautiful Markdown style... accented in **red**.

***

### *Delicately formatted.*  *Exquisitely styled.*

\-- md[RED] is a remix of current Markdown stylesheets; it champions 
the clean and easy-to-read ***Avenir Next*** font-family for the main document's 
typography, while scattering hints of **red** accent.

Soft **red** foundations exhibit pre-formatted code blocks, 
themselves presented in a ***Bitstream Vera Sans Mono*** typographic poetry.

###  md[RED] features the following:

* Beautiful easy-to-read typography.
* Subtle hyperlink styling, so as not to hinder the document's flow or reader comprehension.
* A multitude of heading variations to fit a majority of needs.
* Poetic, pre-formatted code boxes and inline code styling.
* A few HTML element additions at your disposal during manuscript markup.
* Custom selection highlighting for a unified look and feel.
* Media query dictated font-sizes for increased readability on various screen resolutions.
* An inspiringly clean and minimal print style to top it all off.


###  A few, quick, notes...

Included among the repository files are: a Markdown text document, 
an index HTML page, and the md[RED] Markdown stylesheet.

The file maintained as `markdown.txt` is purely Markdown formatted 
and renders beautifully when used in conjunction with the 
`md[RED].css` stylesheet in a Markdown previewing application.

The included `index.html` document, however, is **purely presentational** in nature. 
This document was *hand-coded* to offer the most semantic, valid, HTML markup
possible and was not rendered by a Markdown conversion engine.  What this means is that
whilst the resultant documents, `markdown.txt` and `index.html`, may *look* equivalent, 
their respective underlying HTML markup is *very different*.
